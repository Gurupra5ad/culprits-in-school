                    <h5 class="content-about">
                        I created this site with the sole intention of bringing all the incidents of sexual abuse, harassment, impropriety and other such crucial matters to the light of day. 
                        There are a lot of cases and endless debates on this topic all over the world, such that when something of this sort happens, media channels will keep it as a hot topic for few days until it all burns down to nothing. 
                        We leave the problem unresolved, the abuser/oppressor unpunished.
                    </h5>
                    <h5 class="content-about">
                        But the recent news that made headlines has left us rather shocked. A sexual harassment case from a well renowned, prestigious school in Chennai has instigated various other school and college students to open up and talk about similar issues that they’ve faced. Here, I would like to express a special thanks to @Kripali, who raised her voice first, motivating all others to do so as well. Since now it’s in the spotlight, I could see a lot of people, mostly Alumni from different schools who’re gathering information about such incidents to raise a formal complaint to the school management. In light of this, I believe this site will act as a medium for students to share their experiences with complete anonymity. The main reason complete anonymity is maintained here is because there are lot of students who’re still in school and are worried about the problems that they might face if they step up complain about a faculty since they have some time left before graduation.

                    <h5 class="content-about">
                        That being said, I request all the Alumni committee from each school to share this site with their juniors to get their complaints. In case you want to register a complaint to your school management, all these data from your school will be rendered in  an Excel sheet and will be shared with you upon request. But do remember, your data is safe here and will not be shared to anyone and everyone !
